# Bcachefs

Bcachefs is an advanced new filesystem for Linux, with an emphasis on
reliability and robustness:

* Copy on write (COW) - like zfs or btrfs

* Good performance - significantly better than existing copy on write filesystems, comparable to ext4/xfs
* Metadata and data checksumming
* Multiple devices, including replication and other types of RAID
* Caching
* Compression
* Encryption
* Snapshots
* Scalable - has been tested to 50+ TB, will eventually scale far higher
* Already working and stable, with a small community of users

## Getting started

Bcachefs is not yet upstream - you'll have to build a kernel to use it. 

First, check out the bcache kernel and tools repositories:

    git clone https://evilpiepirate.org/git/bcachefs.git
    git clone https://evilpiepirate.org/git/bcachefs-tools.git

Build and install as usual - make sure you enable `CONFIG_BCACHE_FS` Then, to
format and mount a single device with the default options, run:

    bcachefs format /dev/sda1
    mount -t bcachefs /dev/sda1 /mnt

See `bcachefs format --help` for more options.
