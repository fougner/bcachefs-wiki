Bcachefs is an advanced new filesystem for Linux, with an emphasis on
reliability and robustness:

* Copy on write (COW) - like zfs or btrfs
* Good performance - significantly better than existing copy on write filesystems, comparable to ext4/xfs
* Metadata and data checksumming
* Multiple devices, including replication and other types of RAID
* Caching
* Compression
* Encryption
* Snapshots
* Scalable - has been tested to 50+ TB, will eventually scale far higher
* Already working and stable, with a small community of users
