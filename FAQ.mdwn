Frequently Asked Questions


## Does bcachefs support ACL/xattrs ?
Yes it supports both ACL and xattrs.


## Do I have to reformat my bcache drive to use the new bcachefs ?

To use the caching device (cdev) with the new bcachefs, you will need to reformat it.
In principle this should not be a problem, as they can be removed from a backing device (bdev/bcache).

If you wish to reuse the backing device (bdev/bcache), you can't this is nolonger an option.

If you wish to use bcachefs as a filesystem you will have to format the backing device (bdev/bcache) with
the new filesystem.

## Does bcachefs still have the bcache caching functionality of block devices ?

No.

## Where do I obtain statically linked bcachefs-tool (for use in initramfs) ?

You can either compile them yourself from source,
or refer to your distribution on how to obtain a statically linked set.

About:
Statically linked programs have all the required dependencies compiled in.
As such, they require no external libraries at runtime.
This does however increase the size of the binary.
