#Build the bcachefs-tools

Firt run the following command to download the bcachefs-tools.

	git clone https://evilpiepirate.org/git/bcachefs-tools.git

This will create a direcorty `bcachefs-tools`.
In this direcorty you will find a file named INSTALL.
This file contains the depencies and some instructions.

To instal run as root:

	make && make install

#Build the bcachefs-tools statically linked.
NOTE: Does not appear to work yet.

Follow the steps above.
But run the following command instead.

	CFLAGS="-static "LDFLAGS="-static" make

Please take note that you also need a static version installed of all required libraries.

#Build the bcachefs-kernel branch.
Firt run the following command to download a kernel branch with the bcachefs patches.

	git clone https://evilpiepirate.org/git/bcachefs.git


This is slighly more complicated to explain.
It's best you look up a tutorial for your specific distribution.

During the configuration make sure you enable `CONFIG_BCACHE_FS`.
To check run `grep CONFIG_BCACHE_FS .config` in in the kernel source.

Tip if your distro kernel supports it you can extract the `.config` used by your distribution,
by running `cat /proc/config.gz | gunzip > /tmp/distro.config`.
